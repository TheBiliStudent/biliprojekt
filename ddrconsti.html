            <h3>The FRG&rsquo;s constitution</h3>
            <p>The &ldquo;Grundgesetz&rdquo; of 1949 was approved by all western occupational forces and all west German states accept Bavaria, who had some doubts. They later changed their minds when all other states had agreed to it.</p>
            <p>It was supposed to be a temporary constitution. The plan was to have a new united constitution since they hoped Germany would become one again. They would base the new constitution of the unified Germany on both constitutions.</p>
            <h3>The GDR&rsquo;s constitution</h3>

            <p>There were three separate official constitution in the state of East Germany. One each from 1949, 1968 and 1974.</p>
            <p>The first constitution was created and approved by the <a href="gpc.html">German People&rsquo;s Congress</a>. It was heavily inspired by the Weimar Constitution, this influence being similar to the Grundgesetzt. It was intended to have a united Germany in mind.</p>
            <p>The constitution introduced two chambers, a &ldquo;L&auml;nderkammer&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Volkeskammer&rdquo;. &nbsp;Basic rights and &nbsp;were also put into the written text.</p>
            <p>The constitution left the possibility for both a unified Germany or a socialist State.</p>
            <p>Over time the SED slowly change certain aspects they were holding elections via one of the SEDs organisations.</p>
            <p>After Walter Ulbricht became chairman, a new constitution was created to be more socialist. Their goal was to become a communist society.</p>
            <p>It said that the government should consist of workers in the SED.</p>
            <p>The last change was made in 1974. The new constitution left out the possibility for a unified Germany as the GDR government wanted to create an individual national identity.</p>
            <p>A change to the constitution was made after the peaceful revolution. They rewrote it to be less communist and deleting the passage which gave the SED their sole power.</p>
