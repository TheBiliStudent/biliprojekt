            <h3>The GDR&rsquo;s constitution</h3>
            <p>There were three separate official constitution in the state of East Germany. One each from 1949, 1968 and 1974.</p>
            <p>The first constitution was created and approved by the <a href="gpc.html">German People&rsquo;s Congress</a>. It was heavily inspired by the Weimar constitution, this influence being similar to the Grundgesetzt. It was intended to have a united Germany in mind.</p>
            <p>The constitution introduced two chambers, a &ldquo;L&auml;nderkammer&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Volkeskammer&rdquo;. &nbsp;Basic rights and &nbsp;were also put into the written text of the constitution.</p>
            <p>The constitution left the possibility for a unified Germany or a socialist State.</p>
            <p>Over time the SED slowly change certain aspects as holding elections via one of the SEDs organisations.</p>
            <p>After Walter Ulbricht became chairman, a new constitution was created to be more socialist. Their goal was to become a socialist society.</p>
            <p>It said that the government should consist of workers in the SED.</p>
            <p>The last change was made in 1974. The new constitution left out the possibility for a unified Germany as the GDR government wanted to create an individual national identity.</p>
            <p>A change to the constitution was made after the peaceful revolution, changing it to be less communist and deleting the passage which gave the SED all the power.</p>
