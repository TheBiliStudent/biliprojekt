            <h2>Democratisation</h2>
            <p>After Germany was defeated and the Allied powers took over governing Germany, the second phase of the transformation process could start.</p>
            <p>At the Potsdam Conference the big three fleshed out their plans on new Germany. They agreed on the five Ds.</p>
            <h4>Denazification</h4>
            <p>All Allied powers saw denazification as an important aspect to transform Germany. The goal was to make the new state&rsquo;s democracy defensive and combative, as well as having Germany not trouble the world order again. For that they abolished and forbid Nazi related organisations.</p>
            <p>Next to this they held the Nuremberg trials not only to punish the old leaders and organisations but also to be show trials. They were charged with crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The trials were recorded, translated and shown to the world. The goals behind this were to not only show what brutal crimes happened in Germany but also that they were holding fair trials, as not everyone was convicted.</p>
            <p>A second part to denazification was reeducation, the plan to have Germany people believe in democracy and supervise the education of children change from the Nazi teachings.</p>
            <h4>Demilitarisation</h4>
            <p>The German military was abolished and any industry that could produce weaponry with it. It was supposed to go along with the deindustrialization.</p>
            <h4>Deindustrialisation</h4>
            <p>The Morgenthau Plan was an idea to completely deindustrialises Germany to an agricultural state. Before the end of the war, Henry Morgenthau Jr. proposed this plan for a post-war Germany. It was never put into action as the allied powers preferred to dismantle most of Germany&rsquo;s industry but kept mines intact for production. In 1947 the US changed course, instead wanting to stabilise Germany as a potential trading partner.</p>
            <h4>Decentralisation</h4>
            <p>In the time before power in Germany had become more centralised. The Allied powers wanted to prevent a centralised power from taking over again. The democratic system in the western occupation zones were build &ldquo;from the ground up&rdquo; separated into local governments, then the &ldquo;Bundesl&auml;nder&rdquo; and finally a central government. At first the German people were supposed to elect local governmentsso the German people could feel the positive effects of democracy.</p>
            <h4>Democratisation</h4>
            <p>As opposed to the democratisation in transformation theory, this democratisation is concerned about creating a democratic constitution.</p>
