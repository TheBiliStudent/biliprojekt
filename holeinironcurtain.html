          <p> With Gorbatschow pushing the Soviet republics to adapt his reform policies, some republics follow his instructions, such as Hungary while others are reluctant about adapting and hold tight to autocratic measurements of retention of power, <br> such as the leadership of the GDR under the command of Erich Honecker. </p>
          <p> With the progressing modernization in Hungary, the closed border of the Iron Curtain to Austria appeared more and more politically inappropriate. The Iron Curtain was dismantled on June 27th, 1989 in a symbolic act by the foreign secretaries <br> of both nations but remained guarded. When finally the decision to open the border was made, hundreds of citizens of the GDR escaped after the opening of the border on September 11th.
