            <h3>Initial position</h3>
            <p>During the Cold War a nuclear arms race took place between the blocks of western NATO-members primarily led by the USA on the one side and the Soviet Union on the other one. <br> Treaties that were supposed to limit the arms race were partly negotiated, eventually not put in place or denounced later. <br> With that, the 1980s could begin with an intensified arms race: </p>
            <p> After the USSR modernized and expanded their middle-range-missiles with the buildup of SS-20-missiles (capable of carrying nuclear warheads), NATO feared a flipping of the <br> so-called “balance of terror” in favor of the USSR. <br> With the aim of seemingly rebalancing, the NATO states passed the “NATO Double-Track Decision” to </p>
            <p> a)  arm Europe with middle-range-missiles  <p> 
            <p> b)  demand negotiations concerning limiting the number of middle-range-missiles in Europe <p>
            <p>The following years of heavier arming made the economic struggle of the SU and their technological disadvantage in comparison to the USA visible, as the SU couldn’t keep pace <br> with the American economy. When Michail Gorbatschow became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he recognized lack of economic power to continue participating in an arms race and called for negotiations about significant disarmament. In combination with his policies of <a href="perestroika.html">"Perestroika"</a> and <a href="glasnost.html">"Glasnost"</a> that aimed at reforming the SU he accelerated the downfall of the SU. </p>
            <p>In the GDR, there were elections conducted in spring of 1989, but the opposition could show that the official results were courrpted. Public unrest increased as a consequence.</p>
