            <h2>Liberalisation</h2>
            <p>When World War II had a foreseeable end, the big three (Churchill, Rosevelt, Stalin) were already discussing what to do with Germany after they would surrender. At the Yalta Conference they were defining what to do with Germany, how to treat Germany once it was finally beaten. <br />They agreed they would separate Germany but left open what exactly that meant. Churchill feared complete separation could weaken the European economy.</p>
            <p>Their united goal was to end war as quickly as possible and the denazification of Germany.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Stalin&rsquo;s goals were for the Eastern European counties to be recognised as part of the USSR. Rosevelt tried getting Stalin to help against Japan and getting him to agree to join the UN. He was successful. Russia joined the fight against Japan. Churchill's goal was to bring democracy to european states which were not democratic at the time.</p>
