            <h2>Liberalisation</h2>
            <p>When World War had a foreseeable end, the big three (Churchill, Rosevelt, Stalin) already discussing what to do with Germany after surrender. At the Yalta Conference they were defining what to do with Germany, how to treat Germany once it was finally beaten. <br />They agreed they would separate Germany but left open what that explicitly meant. Churchill feared complete separation could weaken the European economy.</p>
            <p>Their united goal was to end war as quickly as possible and the denazification of Germany.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Stalin&rsquo;s goals were for the Eastern European counties to be recognised as part of the USSR. Rosevelt tried getting Stalin to help with Japan and getting him to agree to join the UN and was successful. Russia joined against Japan. Churchill wanted Democracy for Europe</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hitler killed himself, the paper for unconditional surrender were signed by Generaloberst Alfred Jodl who was assigned to negotiate the surrender for the western forces on May 7<sup>th</sup>, on May 8<sup>th</sup> it was put into action.</p>
            <p>Stalin demanded a separate signature on Udssr controlled ground which was signed by Wilhelm Keitel on May 9<sup>th</sup> in Berlin-Karlshorst.</p>
            <p>May 23<sup>rd</sup> the successor of Hitler Karl D&ouml;nitz and his government is arrested, leaving Germany without a government. Germany had been liberated.</p>
            <p>The &ldquo;Berlin Declaration&rdquo; on June 5<sup>th</sup> gives control to the allied forces and separates Germany as well as berlin into four sectors.</p>
