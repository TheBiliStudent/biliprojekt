            <p> When Gorbatschow came into office, he proclaimed the policy of “Perestroika”: <br> The guiding concept of reforms regarding the organization of the economy and administration with the goal of modernizing the SU to strengthen it in the long run. <br> For instance, Gorbatschow  </p>
            <p> - liberalized the economy to unleash market forces through variable prices </p>
            <p> - allowed the workers to elect their management on a local level </p>
            <p> - introduced quality controls to fight low-quality industrial output in exchange of autonomy to firms </p>
            <p> - tried to fight corruption and other infringements within the remaining national administration </p>
            <p> - heavy restrictions on drinks containing alcohol including the destruction of firms producing alcohol </p>
            <p> Some reforms backfired: </p>
            <p>  Workers elected their management based on promises, e.g. how much they would increase the wages, and not on qualification. The result was a mismanaged liberalized economy with yet still some production plans that had to be fulfilled leading to <br> an overall inefficient economy that had severe problems with sufficiently supplying food to the population. </p>
            <p> The strict limitations on the selling of alcohol led to broad unrests within the population. There were long queues in front of shops selling Vodka and its prices rose significantly both in regular shops and on the blackmarket with more and more <br> people using their newly gained freedoms to illegally brew alcohol decreasing productivity in the long run. On top of this the budget of the SU decreased as taxes from alcohol drastically decreased worsening the already severe budgetary position </p>   
            <p> Conclusion: </p>
            <p> His reforms were a first step on a transition of the SU and formed together with “Glasnost” the core of his modernization-policy that accelerated the decline of the SU. </p>
            
            ation with his policies of <a href="perestroika.html">"Perestroika"</a> and <a href="glasnost.htlm">"Glasnost"</a> that aimed at reforming the SU he accelerated the downfall of the SU and ultimately the collapse of the SU with the individual Soviet republics being able to gain their independence. </p>
