          <h2>Embassy refugees in Prague</h2>
            <p>With the opening of the borders from Hungary to Austria on September 11th, 1989, many citizens from the GDR escaped the GDR through this hole in the “Iron Curtain” many others fled to embassies of the FRG in the Soviet republics. <br> For example, on September 30th there were around 4000 citizens from the GDR in the embassy of the FRG in Prague desperately trying to make their way into the FRG.</p>
            <p>In the days before September 30, western-German foreign secretary Hans-Dietrich Genscher negotiated a solution for the thousands of people waiting in the embassy in Prague. They were allowed to leave into the FRG by train from Prague <br> through the GDR. When Genscher stepped on the balcony of the embassy saying</p>
        <p>“Wir sind zu Ihnen gekommen, um Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass heute Ihre Ausreise…“</p>
            <p>and was interrupted by the cheering of the people waiting. </p>
            <p>This marked an important diplomatic achievement for the FRG, since they didn't have to relent in other topics like before to "buy" people free from the embassy.</p>
