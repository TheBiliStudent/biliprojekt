             <p>The song "Wind Of Change" was written by Klaus Meine, the singer of the band "Scorpions" from Hannover, when the band was in the Sowjet Union in the summer of 1989 and is a "personal reappraisal of what happened in the last years in the world". </p>
            <p>In the official music video are video sequences of significant historical moments included, for instance developments at the Potsdam Square in Berlin from the uprisings of June 17 in 1953, to the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 to the fall of it in 1989. </p>
